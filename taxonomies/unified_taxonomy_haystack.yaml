ahu-equip:
  brick: https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#AHU
  definition: 'Assembly consisting of sections containing a fan or fans and other
    necessary equipment to perform one or more of the following functions: circulating,
    filtration, heating, cooling, heat recovery, humidifying, dehumidifying, and mixing
    of air. Is usually connected to an air-distribution system.'

chiller-equip:
  brick: https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#Chiller
  definition: Refrigerating machine used to transfer heat between fluids. Chillers
    are either direct expansion with a compressor or absorption type.

coolingCoil-equip:
  brick: https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#Cooling_Coil
  definition: A cooling element made of pipe or tube that removes heat from equipment,
    machines or airflows. Typically filled with either refrigerant or cold water.

coolingTower-equip:
  brick: https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#Cooling_Tower
  definition: A cooling tower is a heat rejection device that rejects waste heat to
    the atmosphere through the cooling of a water stream to a lower temperature. Cooling
    towers may either use the evaporation of water to remove process heat and cool
    the working fluid to near the wet-bulb air temperature or, in the case of closed
    circuit dry cooling towers, rely solely on air to cool the working fluid to near
    the dry-bulb air temperature.

economizer-equip:
  brick: https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#Economizer
  definiton: Device that, on proper variable sensing, initiates control signals or
    actions to conserve energy. A control system that reduces the mechanical heating
    and cooling requirement.

heatExchanger-equip:
  brick: https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#Heat_Exchanger
  definition: A heat exchanger is a piece of equipment built for efficient heat transfer
    from one medium to another. The media may be separated by a solid wall to prevent
    mixing or they may be in direct contact (BEDES)

heatingCoil-equip:
  brick: https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#Heating_Coil
  definition: A heating element typically made of pipe, tube or wire that emits heat.
    Typically filled with hot water, or, in the case of wire, uses electricity.
