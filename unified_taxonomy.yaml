    Air Handling Unit:
      definition: "Assembly consisting of sections containing a fan or fans and other necessary equipment to perform one or more of the following functions: circulating, filtration, heating, cooling, heat recovery, humidifying, dehumidifying, and mixing of air. Is usually connected to an air-distribution system."

    Heat Exchanger:
      definition: "A heat exchanger is a piece of equipment built for efficient heat transfer from one medium to another. The media may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing or they may be in direct contact (BEDES)"

    Chiller:
      definition: "Refrigerating machine used to transfer heat between fluids. Chillers are either direct expansion with a compressor or absorption type."

    Coil:
      definition: "Cooling or heating element made of pipe or tube that may or may not be finned and formed into helical or serpentine shape (ASHRAE Dictionary)"

      children:
        Cooling Coil:
          definition: "A cooling element made of pipe or tube that removes heat from equipment, machines or airflows. Typically filled with either refrigerant or cold water."
          brick: https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#Cooling_Coil
          proto: coolingCoil-equip
        Heating Coil:
          definition: "A heating element typically made of pipe, tube or wire that emits heat. Typically filled with hot water, or, in the case of wire, uses electricity."
          brick: https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#Heating_Coil
          proto: heatingCoil-equip
    Cooling Tower:
      definition: "A cooling tower is a heat rejection device that rejects waste heat to the atmosphere through the cooling of a water stream to a lower temperature. Cooling towers may either use the evaporation of water to remove process heat and cool the working fluid to near the wet-bulb air temperature or, in the case of closed circuit dry cooling towers, rely solely on air to cool the working fluid to near the dry-bulb air temperature."

    Economizer:
      definiton: "Device that, on proper variable sensing, initiates control signals or actions to conserve energy. A control system that reduces the mechanical heating and cooling requirement."
